AsterNET is an open source framework for Asterisk AMI and FastAGI. AsterNET allows you to talk to Asterisk AMI from any .NET application and create FastAGI applications in any .NET language.

## Components
AsterNET is made up of two key components, FastAGI and Manager Interface. Each allows you to interact with Asterisk in different ways. FastAGI allows you to control the flow of a call from another machine (a dedicated AGI server for example) and Manager Interface allows you to obtain state information and interact with Asterisk.

## History
AsterNET is a fork of Asterisk.NET. Now we've reached release status and AsterNET version 1.0.0 we feel this is a good separation point from the original project.
